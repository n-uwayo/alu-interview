Given a list of non-negative integers representing walls of width 1,
calculate how much water will be retained after it rains.
"""

def rain(walls):
    """
    Calculate the amount of water that can be retained after rainfall.

    This function takes a list of non-negative integers 'walls', where each
    integer represents the height of a wall at a specific position. It calculates
    and returns the amount of water that can be trapped between the walls after
    rainfall.

    Args:
        walls (list of int): A list of non-negative integers representing wall heights.

    Returns:
        int: The total amount of water that can be retained between the walls.

    Example:
        >>> rain([0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1])
        6
